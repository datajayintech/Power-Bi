# Summary of Findings 

For this analysis my main interest was to analyze the customers activity for better insight on which pizza's are in high demand, where can the store improve and what are the stores busiest times. 
Diving into the sales data I was able to determine that the stores first peak hour of the day is from 12pm to 1pm. This is good to know when it comes to scheduling to make sure the store has enough employees between that time for better effiencieny. It will be good for customers to know they will not have to wait to long for their order and encourage them to spread word around town. On the stores not so busy times, the store can try a variation of things such as lunch specials or dinner specials. 
Diving further into the data I was also able to identify that the top ordered Pizza is Classic Deluxe, but the one bringing in the most revenue is Thai Chicken. This was due to pricing. Since Classic Deluxe is more affordable people natural order more boxes. 

Some trends I noticed is that there is a drop in orders and in revenue in the 4th quarter. This could be for a few reasons such as holidays, back to school time or more people on vacations. During 4th quarter the store can try out holiday specials such as buy one, get one or 20% off. Holidays usually means party time with family and more people cooking, but everyone loves pizza it just has to be advertised in an abnormally affordable way.
